			<p>Exscinders are Heaven's censors, scouring the planes for texts containing information 
                too evil or dangerous to be allowed to exist. They never hesitate to act, and never 
                second-guess their decisions, unquestioningly believing themselves to be above the faults 
                of mere mortals. They are corporeal manifestation of gods of justice, vengeance, wrath, 
                censorship and command whose sheer force of will and self-rightfulness spark idolisation 
                from mortals longing for a purpose. Devotion to, and embodiment of their guiding principles 
                are often rewarded with destructive gifts from the gods they herald.

			<p>Also at 1st level, you can turn harmful words against those that uttered them. When a creature within 60 feet of you that you can see targets you or an area you are in with a spell with verbal components, you can use your reaction to cause the creature to make a Wisdom saving throw. The creature takes 1d6 fire damage and 1d6 radiant damage on a failed saving throw, and half as much damage on a successful one. On a failed saving throw, you gain advantage on your Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma saving throw against the triggering spell effect, if applicable.  
				You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

			<p>Starting at 17th level, you can delay death for an instant to perform a final heroic act. 
			   When you are reduced to 0 hit points by an attacker you can see, even if you would be killed 
			   outright, you sprout wings of white holy fire, gain a flying speed equal to your current 
			   walking speed, and can use your reaction to move up to your speed toward the attacker and 
			   make one melee weapon attack against it, as long as the movement brings it within your reach. 
			   You make this attack with advantage. If the attack hits, the creature takes an extra 5d10 fire 
			   damage and an extra 5d10 damage of the weapon's type. You then fall unconscious and begin making 
			   death saving throws as normal, or you die if the damage you took would have killed you outright. 
			   Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
