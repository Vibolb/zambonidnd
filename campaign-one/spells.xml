Make a melee spell attack or a melee attack with Lex Talionis against the creature whose attack triggered this reaction.

        <description>
            <p>
                You call forth a draconic spirit. It manifests in an unoccupied 
                space that you can see within range. This corporeal form uses 
                the Draconic Spirit stat block. When you cast this spell, choose 
                a family of dragon: chromatic, gem, or metallic. The creature resembles 
                a dragon of the chosen family, which determines certain traits in 
                its stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 hit points 
                or when the spell ends.
            </p>
            <p>
                The creature is an ally to you and your companions. In combat, 
                the creature shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn
                immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action 
                required by you). If you don't issue any, it takes the Dodge action
                and uses its move to avoid danger.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong></em> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, use the higher level wherever the spell's level appears in the stat block.

                In addition, attacks made using a weapon under the effects

                The reach is extended by 5 feet for attacks mafe with this weapon.

                returns to one of your free hands at the end of your turn

                You weave magic in a swirl as you fall, creating an invisible,

                A swirling coil of fierce wind rises around one creature
                 that you can see within range and attempt to lift them into
                  the sky. The target must make a Strength saving throw. On

                  target is Large or smaller, it is lifted 30 feet up into the air.
                   It remains aloft until the end of your next turn when the spell 
                   ends, at which point it is dropped and begins to fall. While held

                    successful save, the target takes half damage and isn't launched airborne.

                For the duration your AC becomes 13 + your Dexterity 
                modifier. You may hover up to 2 inches above the ground 
                instead of walking on it, this exerts a one tenth of the 
                usual force under each of your foot. Your movement speed 
                increases by 5 feet. Whenever you are targeted by a melee 
                weapon attack you can use your reaction to move 5 feet in 
                any direction, causing the attack to potentially miss you 
                if you leave its range. You can't use this reaction if you 
                already spent the extra movement speed this turn, and using 
                it lowers your movement speed by 5 feet until the beginning

                You place an illusion on a creature or an object you 
                touch so that divination spells reveal false information 
                about it. The target can be a willing creature or an object 
                that isn't being carried or worn by another creature. 
            </p>
            <p>
                When you cast the spell, choose one or both of the following
                 effects. The effect lasts for the duration. If you cast this
                 spell on the same creature or object every day for 30 days, 
                 placing the same effect on it each time, the illusion lasts 
                 until it is dispelled.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>False Aura.</strong> You change the way the target 
                appears to spells and magical effects, such as Detect Magic, 
                that detect magical auras. You can make a nonmagical object 
                appear magical, a magical object appear nonmagical, or change 
                the object's magical aura so that it appears to belong to a 
                specific school of magic that you choose. When you use this 
                effect on an object, you can make the false magic apparent 
                to any creature that handles the item.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Mask.</strong> You change the way the target appears 
                to spells and magical effects that detect creature types, 
                such as a paladin's Divine Sense or the trigger of a symbol 
                spell. You choose a creature type and other spells and magical 
                effects treat the target as if it were a creature of that type 
                or of that alignment.

                You deliver a stern word of rebuke, empowered by your consecration into holy mysteries, against a creature within
                range that can understand a language (not necessarily a language you speak). The target must succeed a Wisdom 
                saving throw or take 1d6 psychic damage. If it fails this saving throw and ends its next turn closer to you than 
                it began that turn, it suffers the cantrip's damage again (roll the damage a second time).
            </p>
            <p>
                The spell's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).

                You touch a weapon with faerie dust, giving it a burst of anima to carry it into the air. For the next
                minute, the weapon's reach becomes 60 feet, but it remains a melee weapon. When a creature attacks with it,

                An incorporeal spectral fireflower appears hovering in a space of your choice within range and 
                lasts for the duration. It sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 
                5 feet. As part of casting the spell and as a bonus action on each of your subsequent turns, you 
                can unleash fiery pollen from the flower. When you do, you can choose up to one creature you can 
                see to be healed by the fire, and up to one creature you can see to be harmed by it, both must be 
                within 5 feet of the flower. The fireflower heals the for 1d4 hit points if its healing pool is not 
                depleted, and harms for 1d4 fire damage. A harmed target makes a Dexterity saving throw, halving 
                the damage on the success. A target sharing the flower's space has disadvantage on its saving throw. 
                As part of the same bonus action, you may move the flower up to 10 feet in any direction. 
                The fireflower can heal a number of times equal to 1 + your spellcasting ability modifier 
                (minimum of twice) until its healing pool is depleted.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>At higher levels:</strong>For each spell level above the 3rd, the healing and damage of the 
                spell increases by 1d4. The amount of feet you can move the bloom also increases by 10 feet for 
                every two spell levels above the 3rd.
