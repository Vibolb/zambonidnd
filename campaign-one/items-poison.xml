				<em>
					A forest infested with ettercaps transforms into a gloomy place, choked with webs, filled with corpses
					 hanging from trees and infested with giant spiders, giant insects, and other sinister predators.
				</em>
			</p>
			<p>A creature can spend an action to coat 1 melee weapon, or 3 pieces of ammunition with this poison. 
                The poison lasts for 1 minute, or until it successfully affects a target. A creature hit with a 
                weapon coated with this poison must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or take 1d8 poison
                damage and be poisoned for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of 
                its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
