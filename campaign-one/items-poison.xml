                The poison lasts for 1 minute, or until it successfully affects a target. A creature hit with a 
                weapon coated with this poison must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or take 1d8 poison
                damage and be poisoned for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of

					By infusing this magic concoction with their blood, skilled poisoners can challenge their victim to a battle of will. One they can't win, just try to not lose.

			<p>This poison must be mixed with a creature's blood (the poisoner) to become effective. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed a Charisma Saving throw or become charmed by the poisoner for a few hours. The DC equals 12 + the poisoner's charisma modifier and the effect lasts for a number of hours equal the poisoner's charisma modifier (minimum of 1). During that time, the target feels compelled to obey the poisoner's commands, unless it causes them or their allies direct harm. The target can repeat the saving throw each time they take damage. They roll with disadvantage if the source of the damage is the poisoner. This poison requires only one tenth of the usual dosage to be effective.
