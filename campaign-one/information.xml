			<p>
				Fused armor means that any armor you are wearing 
				when the fusion happens disappears and becomes the aformentionned item in its 
				unmanifested state. Any armor stat relative to the original armor's type
				is replaced by the fused item's armor stats, if it has any. Refer to the armor's 
				manifested state information for its armor type and stats in that state.
